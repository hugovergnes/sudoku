## About The Project

This project is an exploration of solving Sudoku puzzles using a heuristic approach that mimics human strategies.
It involves representing the Sudoku board as a `Table` class, where each individual cell is an instance of the `Cell` class.

The main aim is to have fun with a puzzle that has fascinated me since childhood while applying and practicing principles of good software engineering.


## Getting Started

This project uses widely spread Python libraries, so you can simply run the main.py file to execute the code.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement simple solving
- [ ] Implement backtracking
- [ ] Add Additional Examples
